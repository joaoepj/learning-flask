# learning-flask

This repo is about learning-flask. I am creating a Flask App from scratch.

## See it in action
```
$ cd learning-flask
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
## Listen at specific address
```
app.run(host=<set ip in code>)
$ python app.py

```
Then access the page in http://ipaddress:5000
